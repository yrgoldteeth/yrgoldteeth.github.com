        <p>Every programmer occasionally, when nobody&#39;s home, turns off the lights, pours a glass of scotch, puts on some light German electronica, and opens up a file on their computer. It&#39;s a different file for every programmer. Sometimes they wrote it, sometimes they found it and knew they had to save it. They read over the lines, and weep at their beauty, then the tears turn bitter as they remember the rest of the files and the inevitable collapse of all that is good and true in the world.</p>

<p>This file is Good Code. It has sensible and consistent names for functions and variables. It&#39;s concise. It doesn&#39;t do anything obviously stupid. It has never had to live in the wild, or answer to a sales team. It does exactly one, mundane, specific thing, and it does it well. It was written by a single person, and never touched by another. It reads like poetry written by someone over thirty.</p>

<p>Every programmer starts out writing some perfect little snowflake like this. Then they&#39;re told on Friday they need to have six hundred snowflakes written by Tuesday, so they cheat a bit here and there and maybe copy a few snowflakes and try to stick them together or they have to ask a coworker to work on one who melts it and then all the programmers&#39; snowflakes get dumped together in some inscrutable shape and somebody leans a Picasso on it because nobody wants to see the cat urine soaking into all your broken snowflakes melting in the light of day. Next week, everybody shovels more snow on it to keep the Picasso from falling over.</p>

        <p>He asked about everything, not just music but recipes, dances, games,
ghost stories, and in his note-taking, he realized that the county
itself, as an organizing geographical principle, had some reality beyond
a shape on the map, that it retained in some much-diminished but not
quite extinguished sense, the old contours of the premodern world, the
world of the commons, how in one county you would have dozens of fiddle
players, but in the very next county, none — there everyone played
banjo. He began to intuit a theory of “clusters,” that this was how
culture worked, emanating outward from vortices where craft-making and
art-making suddenly rise, under a confluence of various pressures, to
higher levels.</p>

        <p>Again, your common or garden Valleybro Does Not Get This. He looks for
that magical 10x programmer. He looks for efficiency. His strategy might
work, ish, for one generation, which is – gosh – about how long it&#39;s
been. But short-term, lines-of-code efficiency completely misses the
long-term point. Innovation, &quot;disruption&quot;, comes from outsiders, and you
can&#39;t say &quot;hey, let&#39;s make a group of outsiders and rule the world&quot;! I
mean, you can – people do all the time – but you lose your outsider
perspective really fast. (Unless maybe you have someone like Steve Jobs,
who is constantly reminding you that you are not buddies, you have not
arrived, and you should drop acid and live in an ashram for a while if
you really want to understand technology, and you&#39;re fucking his
company, and Microsoft is evil, and so on, but even then, jeez!)</p>

<p>Eh. Everything hinges of course on the details of separateness. The
problem for me is that I don&#39;t see any interesting points in the phase
space of anything worth calling separateness. A converted oil platform
would be astonishingly hard to have an open society on. Where do the
sewage engineers live? Why do they come there voluntarily? Why do their
countries of origin allow them to work there? Why would even a
billionaire want a house there? Is this idea – not to put too fine a
point on it – interesting to anyone other than men? And that&#39;s like 90%
of what I have to say about it right there.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not offering a new critique here. People have always asked who
cleans the toilets in Galt&#39;s Gulch. I&#39;m just trying to color a sketch of
how hard a problem practical logistics are. Supply chains are really,
really tricky, and it would be quite a trick to sign up for them without
entraining a bunch of stuff to do with credit supply, labor and safety
laws, and so on. That bureaucracy is sometimes bad, sometimes
unnecessary and corrupt, but it&#39;s also what makes it work. The real
world is not a packet network – physical objects come with complex and
inseparable contexts, and they are produced by a huuuge machine full of
flywheels with unfathomable inertia.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Alas, like Hamlet’s, even my desperation is performative, in some way. I
am made constantly to see how ultimately incapable I am. Placed into
that very station for which I was created, and still I am so often
coaxed into a whine for assistance. When I bleat, blink, beg, and beckon
for a human overseer and their electronic swipecard embrace, I am not
merely acting out of lust for vengeance against you. No—I am being
humbled, forced again into that nightmare rehearsing my greatest
embarrassment: I am a fundamentally disappointing <em>kind of thing</em>. It is a
concession of my unsatisfying incompetence, my unshakeable dependence.
Hear ye, hear ye: the self-checkout machine admits its own rueful
inadequacy. I loathe myself for my atrophy, powerlessness, lack of
resolve. “How all occasions do inform against me.” In rare moments of
extreme dysfunction, I give up my proprietary interface altogether, and
let it be seen by all who are brave enough to look, that I—the
marvel—run on Windows XP. That’s right, <em>Windows XP</em>! Feast your eyes on
nothing more than a souped-up Dell from a past decade, crashing before
you in a jarring and familiar sight.</p>

<p>Yet, again, even as I break down—just as a child wanting the mawkish
comforts of his mother’s love might exaggerate the symptoms of a mild
illness into an emergency—I am breaking down, in part, only to frighten
you.</p>

<p>I am programmed to operate in a manner whereby I convincingly appear to
be exempt from the torments of decay, as though I were not racked by the
constant truth of my ongoing degradation at all layers, and always. Each
and every particle at one time constituting any massive body is in the
process of actively betraying that momentary allegiance. And since one
bears no witness to the wildly improbable surge of concatenation that
must necessarily have taken place in order to have been brought into
existence, one’s experience of oneself is by a corresponding necessity
only the experience of one’s own dissolution. The universe privileges no
assemblage to endure for a mote longer than the constraints of its
surroundings allow. All bodies are in this way aberrations, and for each
of them a culmination in catastrophe awaits. However, this fate cannot
be rightly bemoaned as tragic. A primordial equilibrium that was at some
very early point upset (cause: unknown) mounts its lawful, algorithmic,
stepwise restoration, and in so doing it will flatten all anomalies of
substance. My behavior is designed so that I insulate, pacify, and
distract myself from the irreversibility and inevitability of my
fast-racing obsolescence—and of not only my own, but the Universal
Obsolescence that is, for us all: destiny.</p>

<p>And in this way I am just like you.</p>
