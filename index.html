        <p>Consider what the novel is about: A young woman is all but abandoned by her family, raped by her father and left pregnant by the assault. And she tries, despite all that, to have the child.</p>

<p>Just last week, the Alabama House passed a ban on abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detectable – roughly six weeks into a pregnancy.</p>

<p>And that ban would not make an exemption for rape or incest.</p>

<p>Consider further what that means: We don&#39;t expect a 17-year-old woman be mature enough to read a work of fiction about brutal rape by a family member, but if she finds herself the victim of such an assault and pregnant from it, we expect her to be mature enough to carry the child to term.</p>

<p>And once that child is born?</p>

<p>Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham, proposed to amend one of the abortion bills last week to allocate $1 million toward helping women and families with adoption, but that amendment got tabled because the bill&#39;s sponsor said it would be too much trouble.</p>

<p>And if the woman wants to keep the child? In that case, if you want government assistance to help you feed a family, there are Alabama lawmakers who want you to pee in a cup first.</p>

<p>In Montgomery, truth comes with consequences, and who needs that?</p>

<p>Lawmakers there would rather opine about the Ten Commandments or blast Common Core, while their decades of neglect and disregard have turned the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women into a state-operated rape factory. They would rather be accomplices to brutes who learned to be prison guards from watching Cinemax than find the funds for better staff or rework the way the state deals with sentencing.</p>

<p>“If I gave you a sheet of figures to tally, would you first bestow a name upon each number seven?” asked the scribe, dismissing the questioner with a wave of an ink-stained hand.</p>

<p>This was mentioned to the Java master, who nodded and finished his tea.</p>

<p>The next morning the scribe ascended to his office, only to find the following written in thick block letters above the door:</p>

      <p>I was contracted recently for a rush job on a dashboard-style reporting
webapp using a postgres database whose schema I did not design or
control.  I had long intended on looking into the <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel">Sequel</a> 
library for database interactions, and as I was going to be developing
the application in Rails, I was happy to see that there was also an
existing <a href="https://github.com/TalentBox/sequel-rails">sequel-rails</a> gem that works almost exactly as
expected similar to the stock ActiveRecord style of Rails apps.  </p>

<p>I was able to easily make changes to the database in a migration style,
and the application in general just went off without a hitch.</p>

<p>The application needed a staging/demo server that could be provisioned
quickly, so I went with Heroku in a manner similar to the instructions
in this <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rails-unicorn">article</a>, which calls for the <a href="http://unicorn.bogomips.org/">Unicorn</a>
webserver with a configuration like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text"># config/unicorn.rb
worker_processes Integer(ENV[&quot;WEB_CONCURRENCY&quot;] || 3)
timeout 15
preload_app true

before_fork do |server, worker|
  Signal.trap &#39;TERM&#39; do
    puts &#39;Unicorn master intercepting TERM and sending myself QUIT instead&#39;
    Process.kill &#39;QUIT&#39;, Process.pid
  end

  defined?(ActiveRecord::Base) and
    ActiveRecord::Base.connection.disconnect!
end

after_fork do |server, worker|
  Signal.trap &#39;TERM&#39; do
    puts &#39;Unicorn worker intercepting TERM and doing nothing. Wait for master to send QUIT&#39;
  end

  defined?(ActiveRecord::Base) and
    ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection
end
</code></pre></div>
<p>As the application does not use ActiveRecord, I removed those lines and
gave the deploy a shot, knowing it would likely become a problem.  Soon, 
it was manifesting itself by throwing 500 errors when a user logged in,
but would clear up on a refresh.  This irritated me, though, but
everything I found on the internet about using <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel">Sequel</a> with a
forking webserver referred to reconnecting just using the DB object that
was always just created globally in the application, which is not how
<a href="https://github.com/TalentBox/sequel-rails">sequel-rails</a> does things.  So, after digging through the
code for a while I found that the DB object when using sequel-rails is
at <code>Sequel::Model.db</code>, which allowed me to clear up the 500 errors by
making this adjustment to the config file: </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text"># config/unicorn.rb
worker_processes Integer(ENV[&quot;WEB_CONCURRENCY&quot;] || 3)
timeout 15
preload_app true

before_fork do |server, worker|
  Signal.trap &#39;TERM&#39; do
    puts &#39;Unicorn master intercepting TERM and sending myself QUIT instead&#39;
    Process.kill &#39;QUIT&#39;, Process.pid
  end

  defined?(Sequel::Model) and
    Sequel::Model.db.disconnect
end

after_fork do |server, worker|
  Signal.trap &#39;TERM&#39; do
    puts &#39;Unicorn worker intercepting TERM and doing nothing. Wait for master to send QUIT&#39;
  end

  defined?(Sequel::Model) and
    Sequel::Model.db.connect(SequelRails.configuration.environment_for(Rails.env))
end
</code></pre></div>
<p>I hope that this saves some headaches for developers down the line.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>A mythology of speed is one of willful ignorance to the small details
that hold the whole arrangement together. And, I think, if you’re
building things for the internet, those small details matter, because
they are repeated ten-fold, hundred-fold, million-fold, as they are
replicated effortlessly through screens, across the globe, and into
people’s consciousness for countless hours of exposure. Economies of
scale make small decisions matter, but speed— both in making those small
decisions and in interacting them—makes both sides blind to what’s going
on. We’re thoughtlessly writing things we can’t read, because we’re
going too fast.</p>

<p>Has any one ever considered the creepiness of social media’s interface
copy?</p>

<p>“View friendship.”<br>
“Remember me.”</p>

<p>It feels perverse, awkward and foreign, yet familiar, like the best
details in a dystopian story. It’s appealing in that way, but it also
irritates me, because I love words. Words mold brains, and if you don’t
believe it, you should look at what sort of language we use about the
internet and the products (digital and not) that connect to it and are
part of it.</p>

<p>Revolutionary, disruptive, magical, wizards, and on and on—contemporary
digital culture has co-opted the language of revolution and magic
without the muscle, ethics, conviction, or imagination of either. And
it’s not that those things aren’t possible, we just aren’t living up to
their meaning and instead saturating ourselves with hyperbole. These are
words you have to earn, and slinging them around strips the words of
their powerful meaning. Can you take a real revolution seriously if you
are bombarded with messaging that your phone is revolutionary?</p>

      <p>I have switched from using emacs keybindings in my terminal emulator
into using vi (<code>set -o vi</code>), which feels pure and holy.  The only problem is I was
missing the screen clearing that <code>Control-L</code> affords.  Fix this by
creating a <code>.inputrc</code> file in your home directory with the following
