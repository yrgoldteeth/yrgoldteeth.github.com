        <p>I was in Birmingham a few years ago, speaking with some civil-rights-movement veterans there. One of them told me that whenever Martin Luther King Jr. was in town, he helped to protect him. That’s all he said, so I asked, “How did you protect him?” And he said, “With a nonviolent .38 police special.” Everyone laughed and nodded these knowing smiles.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>There’s the story of Annie “Mama Dolly” Raines, in southwest Georgia, up in the window with her shotgun protecting Charles Sherrod, the nonviolent organizer who was staying with her. She was a midwife and she told him, “I brought a lot of these white folks into this world, and I’ll take ’em out of this world if I have to.” That’s what people overlook in discussions of this period. Yes, there was tremendous oppression, brutal oppression. But there was also strength, which is part of what oppression generates. There were good grounds for fear, but that fear created a kind of toughness that wasn’t limited to the men. I can certainly testify that without the women, I might be dead.</p>

        <p>Every programmer occasionally, when nobody&#39;s home, turns off the lights, pours a glass of scotch, puts on some light German electronica, and opens up a file on their computer. It&#39;s a different file for every programmer. Sometimes they wrote it, sometimes they found it and knew they had to save it. They read over the lines, and weep at their beauty, then the tears turn bitter as they remember the rest of the files and the inevitable collapse of all that is good and true in the world.</p>

<p>This file is Good Code. It has sensible and consistent names for functions and variables. It&#39;s concise. It doesn&#39;t do anything obviously stupid. It has never had to live in the wild, or answer to a sales team. It does exactly one, mundane, specific thing, and it does it well. It was written by a single person, and never touched by another. It reads like poetry written by someone over thirty.</p>

<p>Every programmer starts out writing some perfect little snowflake like this. Then they&#39;re told on Friday they need to have six hundred snowflakes written by Tuesday, so they cheat a bit here and there and maybe copy a few snowflakes and try to stick them together or they have to ask a coworker to work on one who melts it and then all the programmers&#39; snowflakes get dumped together in some inscrutable shape and somebody leans a Picasso on it because nobody wants to see the cat urine soaking into all your broken snowflakes melting in the light of day. Next week, everybody shovels more snow on it to keep the Picasso from falling over.</p>

        <p>He asked about everything, not just music but recipes, dances, games,
ghost stories, and in his note-taking, he realized that the county
itself, as an organizing geographical principle, had some reality beyond
a shape on the map, that it retained in some much-diminished but not
quite extinguished sense, the old contours of the premodern world, the
world of the commons, how in one county you would have dozens of fiddle
players, but in the very next county, none — there everyone played
banjo. He began to intuit a theory of “clusters,” that this was how
culture worked, emanating outward from vortices where craft-making and
art-making suddenly rise, under a confluence of various pressures, to
higher levels.</p>

        <p>Again, your common or garden Valleybro Does Not Get This. He looks for
that magical 10x programmer. He looks for efficiency. His strategy might
work, ish, for one generation, which is – gosh – about how long it&#39;s
been. But short-term, lines-of-code efficiency completely misses the
long-term point. Innovation, &quot;disruption&quot;, comes from outsiders, and you
can&#39;t say &quot;hey, let&#39;s make a group of outsiders and rule the world&quot;! I
mean, you can – people do all the time – but you lose your outsider
perspective really fast. (Unless maybe you have someone like Steve Jobs,
who is constantly reminding you that you are not buddies, you have not
arrived, and you should drop acid and live in an ashram for a while if
you really want to understand technology, and you&#39;re fucking his
company, and Microsoft is evil, and so on, but even then, jeez!)</p>

<p>Eh. Everything hinges of course on the details of separateness. The
problem for me is that I don&#39;t see any interesting points in the phase
space of anything worth calling separateness. A converted oil platform
would be astonishingly hard to have an open society on. Where do the
sewage engineers live? Why do they come there voluntarily? Why do their
countries of origin allow them to work there? Why would even a
billionaire want a house there? Is this idea – not to put too fine a
point on it – interesting to anyone other than men? And that&#39;s like 90%
of what I have to say about it right there.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not offering a new critique here. People have always asked who
cleans the toilets in Galt&#39;s Gulch. I&#39;m just trying to color a sketch of
how hard a problem practical logistics are. Supply chains are really,
really tricky, and it would be quite a trick to sign up for them without
entraining a bunch of stuff to do with credit supply, labor and safety
laws, and so on. That bureaucracy is sometimes bad, sometimes
unnecessary and corrupt, but it&#39;s also what makes it work. The real
world is not a packet network – physical objects come with complex and
inseparable contexts, and they are produced by a huuuge machine full of
flywheels with unfathomable inertia.</p>
