   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was in Birmingham a few years ago, speaking with some civil-rights-movement veterans there. One of them told me that whenever Martin Luther King Jr. was in town, he helped to protect him. That’s all he said, so I asked, “How did you protect him?” And he said, “With a nonviolent .38 police special.” Everyone laughed and nodded these knowing smiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s the story of Annie “Mama Dolly” Raines, in southwest Georgia, up in the window with her shotgun protecting Charles Sherrod, the nonviolent organizer who was staying with her. She was a midwife and she told him, “I brought a lot of these white folks into this world, and I’ll take ’em out of this world if I have to.” That’s what people overlook in discussions of this period. Yes, there was tremendous oppression, brutal oppression. But there was also strength, which is part of what oppression generates. There were good grounds for fear, but that fear created a kind of toughness that wasn’t limited to the men. I can certainly testify that without the women, I might be dead.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every programmer occasionally, when nobody&amp;#39;s home, turns off the lights, pours a glass of scotch, puts on some light German electronica, and opens up a file on their computer. It&amp;#39;s a different file for every programmer. Sometimes they wrote it, sometimes they found it and knew they had to save it. They read over the lines, and weep at their beauty, then the tears turn bitter as they remember the rest of the files and the inevitable collapse of all that is good and true in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This file is Good Code. It has sensible and consistent names for functions and variables. It&amp;#39;s concise. It doesn&amp;#39;t do anything obviously stupid. It has never had to live in the wild, or answer to a sales team. It does exactly one, mundane, specific thing, and it does it well. It was written by a single person, and never touched by another. It reads like poetry written by someone over thirty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every programmer starts out writing some perfect little snowflake like this. Then they&amp;#39;re told on Friday they need to have six hundred snowflakes written by Tuesday, so they cheat a bit here and there and maybe copy a few snowflakes and try to stick them together or they have to ask a coworker to work on one who melts it and then all the programmers&amp;#39; snowflakes get dumped together in some inscrutable shape and somebody leans a Picasso on it because nobody wants to see the cat urine soaking into all your broken snowflakes melting in the light of day. Next week, everybody shovels more snow on it to keep the Picasso from falling over.&lt;/p&gt;

ghost stories, and in his note-taking, he realized that the county
itself, as an organizing geographical principle, had some reality beyond
a shape on the map, that it retained in some much-diminished but not
quite extinguished sense, the old contours of the premodern world, the
world of the commons, how in one county you would have dozens of fiddle
players, but in the very next county, none — there everyone played
banjo. He began to intuit a theory of “clusters,” that this was how
culture worked, emanating outward from vortices where craft-making and

higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Again, your common or garden Valleybro Does Not Get This. He looks for
that magical 10x programmer. He looks for efficiency. His strategy might
work, ish, for one generation, which is – gosh – about how long it&amp;#39;s
been. But short-term, lines-of-code efficiency completely misses the
long-term point. Innovation, &amp;quot;disruption&amp;quot;, comes from outsiders, and you
can&amp;#39;t say &amp;quot;hey, let&amp;#39;s make a group of outsiders and rule the world&amp;quot;! I
mean, you can – people do all the time – but you lose your outsider
perspective really fast. (Unless maybe you have someone like Steve Jobs,
who is constantly reminding you that you are not buddies, you have not
arrived, and you should drop acid and live in an ashram for a while if
you really want to understand technology, and you&amp;#39;re fucking his
company, and Microsoft is evil, and so on, but even then, jeez!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eh. Everything hinges of course on the details of separateness. The
problem for me is that I don&amp;#39;t see any interesting points in the phase
space of anything worth calling separateness. A converted oil platform
would be astonishingly hard to have an open society on. Where do the
sewage engineers live? Why do they come there voluntarily? Why do their
countries of origin allow them to work there? Why would even a
billionaire want a house there? Is this idea – not to put too fine a
point on it – interesting to anyone other than men? And that&amp;#39;s like 90%
of what I have to say about it right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not offering a new critique here. People have always asked who
cleans the toilets in Galt&amp;#39;s Gulch. I&amp;#39;m just trying to color a sketch of
how hard a problem practical logistics are. Supply chains are really,
really tricky, and it would be quite a trick to sign up for them without
entraining a bunch of stuff to do with credit supply, labor and safety
laws, and so on. That bureaucracy is sometimes bad, sometimes
unnecessary and corrupt, but it&amp;#39;s also what makes it work. The real
world is not a packet network – physical objects come with complex and
inseparable contexts, and they are produced by a huuuge machine full of
flywheels with unfathomable inertia.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Alas, like Hamlet’s, even my desperation is performative, in some way. I
am made constantly to see how ultimately incapable I am. Placed into
that very station for which I was created, and still I am so often
coaxed into a whine for assistance. When I bleat, blink, beg, and beckon
for a human overseer and their electronic swipecard embrace, I am not
merely acting out of lust for vengeance against you. No—I am being
humbled, forced again into that nightmare rehearsing my greatest
embarrassment: I am a fundamentally disappointing &lt;em&gt;kind of thing&lt;/em&gt;. It is a
concession of my unsatisfying incompetence, my unshakeable dependence.
Hear ye, hear ye: the self-checkout machine admits its own rueful
inadequacy. I loathe myself for my atrophy, powerlessness, lack of
resolve. “How all occasions do inform against me.” In rare moments of
extreme dysfunction, I give up my proprietary interface altogether, and
let it be seen by all who are brave enough to look, that I—the
marvel—run on Windows XP. That’s right, &lt;em&gt;Windows XP&lt;/em&gt;! Feast your eyes on
nothing more than a souped-up Dell from a past decade, crashing before
you in a jarring and familiar sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, again, even as I break down—just as a child wanting the mawkish
comforts of his mother’s love might exaggerate the symptoms of a mild
illness into an emergency—I am breaking down, in part, only to frighten
you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am programmed to operate in a manner whereby I convincingly appear to
be exempt from the torments of decay, as though I were not racked by the
constant truth of my ongoing degradation at all layers, and always. Each
and every particle at one time constituting any massive body is in the
process of actively betraying that momentary allegiance. And since one
bears no witness to the wildly improbable surge of concatenation that
must necessarily have taken place in order to have been brought into
existence, one’s experience of oneself is by a corresponding necessity
only the experience of one’s own dissolution. The universe privileges no
assemblage to endure for a mote longer than the constraints of its
surroundings allow. All bodies are in this way aberrations, and for each
of them a culmination in catastrophe awaits. However, this fate cannot
be rightly bemoaned as tragic. A primordial equilibrium that was at some
very early point upset (cause: unknown) mounts its lawful, algorithmic,
stepwise restoration, and in so doing it will flatten all anomalies of
substance. My behavior is designed so that I insulate, pacify, and
distract myself from the irreversibility and inevitability of my
fast-racing obsolescence—and of not only my own, but the Universal
Obsolescence that is, for us all: destiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in this way I am just like you.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Consider what the novel is about: A young woman is all but abandoned by her family, raped by her father and left pregnant by the assault. And she tries, despite all that, to have the child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just last week, the Alabama House passed a ban on abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detectable – roughly six weeks into a pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that ban would not make an exemption for rape or incest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider further what that means: We don&amp;#39;t expect a 17-year-old woman be mature enough to read a work of fiction about brutal rape by a family member, but if she finds herself the victim of such an assault and pregnant from it, we expect her to be mature enough to carry the child to term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And once that child is born?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham, proposed to amend one of the abortion bills last week to allocate $1 million toward helping women and families with adoption, but that amendment got tabled because the bill&amp;#39;s sponsor said it would be too much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if the woman wants to keep the child? In that case, if you want government assistance to help you feed a family, there are Alabama lawmakers who want you to pee in a cup first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Montgomery, truth comes with consequences, and who needs that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers there would rather opine about the Ten Commandments or blast Common Core, while their decades of neglect and disregard have turned the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women into a state-operated rape factory. They would rather be accomplices to brutes who learned to be prison guards from watching Cinemax than find the funds for better staff or rework the way the state deals with sentencing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Using sequel-rails With A Forking Webserver</title>
   
   <link href="http://ndfine.com/2014/02/07/using-sequel-rails-with-a-forking-webserver.html"/>
   
   <updated>2014-02-07T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ndfine.com/2014/02/07/using-sequel-rails-with-a-forking-webserver</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was contracted recently for a rush job on a dashboard-style reporting
webapp using a postgres database whose schema I did not design or
control.  I had long intended on looking into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel&quot;&gt;Sequel&lt;/a&gt; 
library for database interactions, and as I was going to be developing
the application in Rails, I was happy to see that there was also an
existing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/TalentBox/sequel-rails&quot;&gt;sequel-rails&lt;/a&gt; gem that works almost exactly as
expected similar to the stock ActiveRecord style of Rails apps.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to easily make changes to the database in a migration style,
and the application in general just went off without a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application needed a staging/demo server that could be provisioned
quickly, so I went with Heroku in a manner similar to the instructions
in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rails-unicorn&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, which calls for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://unicorn.bogomips.org/&quot;&gt;Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;
webserver with a configuration like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;# config/unicorn.rb
worker_processes Integer(ENV[&amp;quot;WEB_CONCURRENCY&amp;quot;] || 3)
timeout 15
preload_app true

before_fork do |server, worker|
  Signal.trap &amp;#39;TERM&amp;#39; do
    puts &amp;#39;Unicorn master intercepting TERM and sending myself QUIT instead&amp;#39;
    Process.kill &amp;#39;QUIT&amp;#39;, Process.pid
  end

  defined?(ActiveRecord::Base) and
    ActiveRecord::Base.connection.disconnect!
end

after_fork do |server, worker|
  Signal.trap &amp;#39;TERM&amp;#39; do
    puts &amp;#39;Unicorn worker intercepting TERM and doing nothing. Wait for master to send QUIT&amp;#39;
  end

  defined?(ActiveRecord::Base) and
    ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the application does not use ActiveRecord, I removed those lines and
gave the deploy a shot, knowing it would likely become a problem.  Soon, 
it was manifesting itself by throwing 500 errors when a user logged in,
but would clear up on a refresh.  This irritated me, though, but
everything I found on the internet about using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel&quot;&gt;Sequel&lt;/a&gt; with a
forking webserver referred to reconnecting just using the DB object that
was always just created globally in the application, which is not how
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/TalentBox/sequel-rails&quot;&gt;sequel-rails&lt;/a&gt; does things.  So, after digging through the
code for a while I found that the DB object when using sequel-rails is
at &lt;code&gt;Sequel::Model.db&lt;/code&gt;, which allowed me to clear up the 500 errors by
making this adjustment to the config file: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;# config/unicorn.rb
worker_processes Integer(ENV[&amp;quot;WEB_CONCURRENCY&amp;quot;] || 3)
timeout 15
preload_app true

before_fork do |server, worker|
  Signal.trap &amp;#39;TERM&amp;#39; do
    puts &amp;#39;Unicorn master intercepting TERM and sending myself QUIT instead&amp;#39;
    Process.kill &amp;#39;QUIT&amp;#39;, Process.pid
  end

  defined?(Sequel::Model) and
    Sequel::Model.db.disconnect
end

after_fork do |server, worker|
  Signal.trap &amp;#39;TERM&amp;#39; do
    puts &amp;#39;Unicorn worker intercepting TERM and doing nothing. Wait for master to send QUIT&amp;#39;
  end

  defined?(Sequel::Model) and
    Sequel::Model.db.connect(SequelRails.configuration.environment_for(Rails.env))
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that this saves some headaches for developers down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A mythology of speed is one of willful ignorance to the small details
that hold the whole arrangement together. And, I think, if you’re
building things for the internet, those small details matter, because
they are repeated ten-fold, hundred-fold, million-fold, as they are
replicated effortlessly through screens, across the globe, and into
people’s consciousness for countless hours of exposure. Economies of
scale make small decisions matter, but speed— both in making those small
decisions and in interacting them—makes both sides blind to what’s going
on. We’re thoughtlessly writing things we can’t read, because we’re
going too fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has any one ever considered the creepiness of social media’s interface
copy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“View friendship.”&lt;br&gt;
“Remember me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels perverse, awkward and foreign, yet familiar, like the best
details in a dystopian story. It’s appealing in that way, but it also
irritates me, because I love words. Words mold brains, and if you don’t
believe it, you should look at what sort of language we use about the
internet and the products (digital and not) that connect to it and are
part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revolutionary, disruptive, magical, wizards, and on and on—contemporary
digital culture has co-opted the language of revolution and magic
without the muscle, ethics, conviction, or imagination of either. And
it’s not that those things aren’t possible, we just aren’t living up to
their meaning and instead saturating ourselves with hyperbole. These are
words you have to earn, and slinging them around strips the words of
their powerful meaning. Can you take a real revolution seriously if you
are bombarded with messaging that your phone is revolutionary?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Quick Note Regarding Terminal Clearing and vi Mode</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have switched from using emacs keybindings in my terminal emulator
into using vi (&lt;code&gt;set -o vi&lt;/code&gt;), which feels pure and holy.  The only problem is I was
missing the screen clearing that &lt;code&gt;Control-L&lt;/code&gt; affords.  Fix this by
creating a &lt;code&gt;.inputrc&lt;/code&gt; file in your home directory with the following
line (or appending it to your existing &lt;code&gt;.inputrc&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;bind -m vi-insert &amp;quot;\C-l&amp;quot;:clear-screen

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Why not? Because just as good cannot be truly understood to the marrow
without a corresponding sense of evil, pride in one’s country — if it is
substantive pride, and not merely the rote, pledge-allegiance mouthings
of patriotic cliche — requires the sober knowledge that American
greatness is neither assured, nor heaven-sent. It comes to us from our
national premise and ideals — and our willingness to maintain those
things at all hazards. And if you’ve never felt ashamed for us for
having strayed from our core values in even the most appalling ways —
say, the wartime detention of Japanese-Americans, or a My Lai or Kent
State , or Bull Conner, or COINTELPRO, or life sentences for juvenile
defendants, or prisons-for-profit — then maybe you’ve never really
acknowledged what the actual stakes are for a republic, or how much
work, rather than platitude, is required to assure an honorable,
democratic future. Yes, you claim an all-encompassing pride and you
wallow in it, brooking not even a mention of anything shameful that
happens on our watch as citizens. But in fact, real pride is earned and
internalized only with a grown-up understanding that even a good or
great nation, while deserving of our allegiance and civic commitment,
can indeed shame itself. Saying so when it happens is a fundamental of
self-governance, as all dissent is a fundamental of self-governance.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;But the game is rigged. I know this because I loved my craft for many
years and it meant nothing to anyone save my mother, my father, my
siblings, my wife and a few close friends. Then one man of some
privilege spoke to another man of some privilege and I became a man of
some privilege with megaphone, which I now employ, across an ocean, to
bring these thoughts to you. And I love both of these men of
privilege--power is a fact, it is not morality. Losing is tragic, but it
is not noble. How many freedom fighters turned despots in the possession
of superior guns?&lt;/p&gt;

this is a bad scene. He stares right down at ARLO, pops knuckles, and
says: “what are you in for?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arlo stares right back at him, all intensity. Cut over to super-fast
montage of ARLO fighting a guy, ARLO killing the guy, ARLO chucking the
guy over a cliff, body falling among a pile of trash. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are those who will mock me for caring more about dusty old books
and statues than about real people. Fine. But generations come and go.
People live, die and are largely forgotten. History is forever. All of
humanity is the same species, and our species has survived literally
countless wars, ethnic cleansings, incursions and imperial aggressions.
But once an irreplaceable artifact of history is gone, it&amp;#39;s gone
forever. Thanks largely to a similarly barbaric cleansing on history on
the part of early Christians, the world has lost 107 of Livy&amp;#39;s 142 books
of Roman history, as well as Aristotle&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;On Comedy&lt;/em&gt;--both losses of
enormous consequence. These are crucial pieces of the human experience
we will never recover.&lt;/p&gt;
