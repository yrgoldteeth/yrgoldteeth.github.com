        <p>Certainly low demand isn’t the only reason why unemployment remains stubbornly high in this recovery; in many sectors, technological change and globalisation have a lot to do with it. But technological change and globalisation have absolutely nothing to do with high unemployment in the construction sector. The people who build things in America will always be Americans, and there haven’t been any revolutions in construction technology between 2007 and 2011 that have made it possible to build bridges, tunnels, trains, electric grids and highways with far fewer employees. The reason the construction sector is sitting on the couch playing with the Wii instead of out fixing America is that America isn’t spending the money to do the fixing. America has a $2 trillion backlog of infrastructure maintenance, according to the Urban Land Institute. With the government able to borrow money at ridiculously low 10-year rates, it seems pretty convincing that we should be borrowing that money and spending it now, both to improve that infrastructure and to get the economy going.  </p>

        <p>Standing next to Clarence was like standing next to the baddest ass on the planet. You were proud, you were strong, you were excited and laughing with what might happen, with what together, you might be able to do. You felt like no matter what the day or the night brought, nothing was going to touch you. Clarence could be fragile but he also emanated power and safety, and in some funny way we became each other&#39;s protectors; I think perhaps I protected &quot;C&quot; from a world where it still wasn&#39;t so easy to be big and black. Racism was ever present and over the years together, we saw it. Clarence&#39;s celebrity and size did not make him immune. I think perhaps &quot;C&quot; protected me from a world where it wasn&#39;t always so easy to be an insecure, weird and skinny white boy either. But, standing together we were badass, on any given night, on our turf, some of the baddest asses on the planet. We were united, we were strong, we were righteous, we were unmovable, we were funny, we were corny as hell and as serious as death itself. And we were coming to your town to shake you and to wake you up. Together, we told an older, richer story about the possibilities of friendship that transcended those I&#39;d written in my songs and in my music. Clarence carried it in his heart. It was a story where the Scooter and the Big Man not only busted the city in half, but we kicked ass and remade the city, shaping it into the kind of place where our friendship would not be such an anomaly. And that... that&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna miss. The chance to renew that vow and double down on that story on a nightly basis, because that is something, that is the thing that we did together... the two of us. Clarence was big, and he made me feel, and think, and love, and dream big. How big was the Big Man? Too fucking big to die. And that&#39;s just the facts. You can put it on his grave stone, you can tattoo it over your heart. Accept it... it&#39;s the New World.  </p>

        <p>Along any axis that we use to measure human beings, we discover a wide-ranging distribution, whether in empathy, intelligence, impulse control, or aggression. People are not created equal. Although this variability is often imagined to be best swept under the rug, it is in fact the engine of evolution. In each generation, nature tries out as many varieties as it can produce, along all available dimensions.</p>

<p>Variation gives rise to lushly diverse societies—but it serves as a source of trouble for the legal system, which is largely built on the premise that humans are all equal before the law. This myth of human equality suggests that people are equally capable of controlling impulses, making decisions, and comprehending consequences. While admirable in spirit, the notion of neural equality is simply not true.  </p>

        <p>In that context, I wondered if he might still sit on the CRT board of directors. Wiedmeyer responded, via phone, that he had no comment. I explained that I wanted only to know if he remained on the board. “I can’t comment on that, you will have to ask the director,” he replied. I again stated that I required only a simple confirmation of membership, at which time Wiedmeyer would only breathe into the phone. I asked if his membership was an official BBA secret, or just something he was ashamed of; still more breathing.</p>

<p>Correspondence and conversations with CRT and BBA members along these lines for the most part merely confirmed what I had suspected about their associations and tactics. There are some old familiar names and faces in this entire endeavor by BARD, Bradley &amp; Associates, and the CRT. Don Erwin of the Barber Companies is frequently seen around town with PowerPoint presentations by which BARD or the Barber Companies can disparage environmental groups and neighborhood associations. It was Erwin who suggested, with a straight face, that residents in Redmont protesting the rezoning of their neighborhood for a Barber condominium were not truly concerned with the neighborhood’s appearance, otherwise they would not have placed on their front lawns banners or placards protesting the rezoning. Perhaps Erwin’s finest hour came during a lawsuit over that Barber development. When asked who his boss was, Erwin replied under oath, “I don’t know.” When asked by a clearly bemused attorney how that was even possible, Erwin claimed that he had never consulted an organizational chart.  </p>

        <p>In 28 Days Later it’s done much more skillfully than ever before. Oh god, the zombies in 28 Days are so fucking scary!!!!! How could anything be as scary as the first half of that film? Yet somehow the army guys are indeed more scary. At first it seems like they are rescuers, even though they shot Brendan Gleeson like a million times after the zombie blood fell out of the crow’s beak and into his eyeball–so, I mean, fair enough, but still. They take the survivors back to their compound. The survivors are sort of conveying that they don’t feel as relieved as they ought to feel; something’s not right. The compound is indeed safe from zombies. There are all these army guys there, the place is surrounded with guns, and the army guys have strict rules and patrols during which the also-aforementioned gleeful mowing-down of zombies occurs. But pretty soon we realize that these guys are psychotic, and it becomes this dreadful rape terror where they’re going to kill Cillian Murphy–leaving him for dead on a huge pile of corpses that it’s sort of ambiguously implied were army victims, not zombie victims, I mean, my god, it’s zombie apocalypse and the army is still taking hundreds of living humans out into fields and shooting them?? WHAT A WORLD–and rape the two ladies millions of times, and it’s just horrible, and suddenly you realize life was way better when they were out in the countryside just fighting off the odd blood-crazed zombie horde, a.k.a. life was better when they were FREE.</p>

<p>Now they live under the law again, under the protection (“protection”) of the military/government, which fights terror with terror, and actually shit is way worse than it was when they were fending for themselves. The fantasy of just “finding an authority figure” and then everything will be okay is here DESTROYED. Just as it is destroyed in real life if you stop to think for two seconds. I mean, I’m really gonna let the TSA feel up my crotch and racially profile random college professors and prohibit scholars of Byzantine erotica from re-entering the country because 0.00000000000000001% of humanity might one day once again hijack a plane in some hard-to-predict way? ARE YOU SERIOUS.  </p>
