> A couple of weeks ago I wrote a...highly snarky deconstruction of the misguided remarks made by two men in the design and web community during a debate about whether a conference roster of all white men is acceptable or not.

Literally hundreds of people wrote in to say how much they agreed with it, supported it, liked it, and, in the case of many women, how relieved they were to see these things being said.
