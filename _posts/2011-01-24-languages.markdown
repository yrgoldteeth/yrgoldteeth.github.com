It's a regret of mine that I, like so many other Americans, only speak one language.  Outside of a couple of
semesters worth of German into which I put basically no effort, I've done nothing to rectify my monolingual 
nature.  Recently, I ran across [this](http://fsi-language-courses.org/Content.php), which looks to be a remarkable
source for learning a new language via the same way American diplomats have done for years.  The US State Department
had a large amount of language courses go into the public domain recently, and we're all the better for it.

For no good particular reason, I've decided to learn Turkish.  I don't have any significant connection to Turkish
culture outside of working for a Turkish guy for a few years
