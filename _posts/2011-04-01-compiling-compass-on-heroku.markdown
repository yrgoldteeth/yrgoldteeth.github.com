title: Getting Compass to Compile Stylesheets on Heroku
---

#### {{ page.title }}

While developing [Groovemux](http://groovemux.com), my homage to the late [Muxtape](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muxtape) I kept running into this issue where my stylesheets in compass were not being compiled on heroku correctly, causing a 500 error every time the app was restarted.  

Happily, I ran across [this posting](http://frontcube.com/blog/2011/how-to-get-sass-to-work-with-rails-3-on-heroku-without-using-any-plugins), and it worked like a charm.  

Also, you should listen to the first mix created for Groovemux [here](http://groovemux.com/tapes/groovemux).  I'm fairly certain it only works in Chrome and Safari.
