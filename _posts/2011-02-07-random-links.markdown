I'm still not so great on updating this on the regular.  I've been digging
through old photos and doing some processing on my huge cache of live music
shots, which has been a fun trip down nostalgia lane.

Beyond that, I'm here to rep:

[My favorite Alabama Football blogger in memory of his dog...](http://bamareport.blogspot.com/2011/02/university-of-alabama-football-report.html)
> My dog is reference-able in a university library system. She's mentioned by name in the acknowledgments of my master's thesis.  That's the section where my classmates put their thesis chairs' names. My thesis chair went on sabbatical for half the damn year; my dog was there every day.

[The case against queues...](http://teddziuba.com/2011/02/the-case-against-queues.html)
> Depending on your queue implementation, when you pop a message off, it's gone. The consumer acknowledges receipt of it, and the queue forgets about it. So, if your data processor fails, you've got data loss. Collecting messages [with] syslog, your processor program is just processing a text file, and can process it again if something goes wrong. Throw in some split and xargs, and you've got parallel processing. Event messages aren't text? You fucked up. Go buy a subscription to the Microsoft Developer Network.
