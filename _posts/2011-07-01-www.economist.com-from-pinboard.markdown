>  Certainly low demand isn’t the only reason why unemployment remains stubbornly high in this recovery; in many sectors, technological change and globalisation have a lot to do with it. But technological change and globalisation have absolutely nothing to do with high unemployment in the construction sector. The people who build things in America will always be Americans, and there haven’t been any revolutions in construction technology between 2007 and 2011 that have made it possible to build bridges, tunnels, trains, electric grids and highways with far fewer employees. The reason the construction sector is sitting on the couch playing with the Wii instead of out fixing America is that America isn’t spending the money to do the fixing. America has a $2 trillion backlog of infrastructure maintenance, according to the Urban Land Institute. With the government able to borrow money at ridiculously low 10-year rates, it seems pretty convincing that we should be borrowing that money and spending it now, both to improve that infrastructure and to get the economy going.
