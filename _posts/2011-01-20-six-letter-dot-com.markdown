Considering that I make my living predominantly writing code that runs on webservers, I had a lingering sense of
guilt that I had no "web presence" to speak of outside of a mostly-ignored Facebook profile and a neglected Twitter
account. Way back in the internet dark-ages I used to have a blog, but have long since allowed all my domains to 
expire. Figuring that the large majority of short .com addresses would have been mostly snatched up by now, I was kind
of shocked to find I could once again be the proud owner of ndfine.com.  Welcome to the result.
