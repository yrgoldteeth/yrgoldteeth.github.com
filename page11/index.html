        <p>INTERVIEWER</p>

<p>Is it true that you spend the whole day in pajamas?  </p>

<p>FOOTE</p>

<p>I live in pajamas. Sometimes I don’t have anything on but pajamas three or four days in a row. If I’m not going out, why get dressed?  </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER</p>

<p>I’ve heard that when the third Civil War volume was finished and you turned it in, it went straight to typesetting without being copyedited.  </p>

<p>FOOTE</p>

<p>So did volume two. I had a funny experience with copy readers back at the outset. They worship reference books and dictionaries and all that ticky kind of thing. We had a sure-enough expert for volume one. He complained that I was using the phrase “by ordinary” instead of ordinarily. He said, That’s incorrect. You shouldn’t do that. I said, No, I’ve heard that and used it all my life. He said, That doesn’t keep it from being wrong. I said, “Well, let’s look.” I opened the Webster’s unabridged and went to ordinary. Under it, it said, “By ordinary—Shelby Foote.” That convinced him.    </p>

        <p>I am sure my ability to have such an ironic detachment from the band is born out of white privilege which of course has led me to feel conflicted about talking about this band. </p>

<p>The other important element of my comment, is the date it is from. I believe that would have been taken from something I said a few years ago. At the time I said it, I perceived the reach of my band and therefor my words to be somewhat limited to the punk/ hardcore world. This meant that the audience I was talking to were peers who would have the same reference points I had (Skrewdriver is the internet porn of punk: almost everyone checks it out but no one admits it) and if anyone needed clarification about something I had said, being that punk and hardcore is a very tight knit scene, I was almost always accessible to that person. The situation however, illustrated by the fact that I am writing to the Guardian about this, has changed. I now try to be a little more cognizant of the ramifications of what I say. I am no longer two or three people removed from just about anyone that will hear me so I have made a distinct effort to not to talk about some of the more darker and esoteric things that I find interesting not because I don&#39;t still find it interesting but because I can&#39;t control the way what I said will be perceived anymore.  </p>

        <p>Books are our most intimate art-form. The reader does a temporary mind-meld with the author, and a collaborative world—their words and our imagination—is conjured from nothing. And because each reader’s mind be his own, each of those conjured worlds, each of those planes, are different. And because the libraries are filled with incredible books, those of us who are readers spend our whole lives creating these private planes, walking them, mapping them, comparing ours with those of other readers, and then returning to our own only to see the contours changed.  And so we map anew.</p>

<p>Why any dedicated reading man would dream of this sorcery strictly with other men is beyond me. It goes against one of the great assets of reading—the voyage to new worlds. It would be as if Magellan said, “I like my small town fine enough.”</p>

<p>Put bluntly, if you call yourself a reading man, but don’t read books by women, you are actually neither. Such a person implicitly dismisses whole swaths of literature, and then flees the challenge to see himself through other eyes.  </p>

        <p>No one death saves a country. But an army’s collective willingness to risk death does. And in this sense every military death must be equal. Some deaths may be more tactically significant or glorious in the retelling or maybe saving of more lives. But each must fundamentally be equal. Because what do we say to the 19 year old in Vietnam who stepped on a land mine to no particular consequence in 1967 when he says to us “I lost my whole life in our common national enterprise. Who will speak for me? Who will remember what I did?” How do we keep that faith, make something more of it than the lost hope? Or the same in Iraq?  </p>
